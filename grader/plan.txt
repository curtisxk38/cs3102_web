things to change per assignment:
a list of problems for that assignment
a list of problems that TA is grading

there is a file per problem containing a list of graded students

there will be a gui for submitting the score and comments. There will be a separate score and comment field for each problem that TA is grading.

to submit there are 2 options: submit and next student, submit and exit

when you submit a score it writes that score to the first line of a comments file. The remaining lines are the comments themselves. There is a comments file per student/problem pair. That student is then added to the graded file for that problem.
